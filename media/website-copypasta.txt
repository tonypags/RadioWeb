Diversity 3.0 EPAD
This is a mix series that I used to do in order to keep my tastes balanced so I don't tire out... plus it's good to have some different mixes for parties and whatnot. This is sort of a mix series without borders. No Rules, just great tracks I've been listening to a lot recently, arranged and overlapped. No Big Deal.

So without further delay... the track list: 

# Title Artist Album 
1 Montreal Kaki King Dreaming Of Revenge 
2 Must Be The Moon !!! Myth Takes

Beastie Boys Mixtape
This is a simple mix intended for my friends this week, because we are all going to the live show in Brooklyn. I tried to assemble both my favorites, and songs that fit well together. I stayed away from the new album (I'm sure we've all listened to that one enough lately, I know I have). I also didn't include many all-time classics. I tried to find the songs that were rarities, b-sides and even a cover or two.
